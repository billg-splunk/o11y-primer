# AWS Management Console

Services are available in the menu or by searching in the search box.

Some services don't need to select the region (e.g. IAM) and others (i.e. regional service, like EC2) need to select a region at the top-right. Most services are region-scoped.

You can check regions to see which services are offered in that region.
